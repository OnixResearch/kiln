# Kiln operator guide

## Local reference run

1. Enter the development shell:

   ```console
   nix develop path:$PWD
   ```

2. Run the standalone fixture:

   ```console
   cargo run -p kiln-cli -- demo
   ```

3. Run all checks:

   ```console
   cargo test --locked --workspace
   cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cairn validate --root . --policy "$PWD/cairn-policy/generated/cairn-policy.json"
   cairn traceability coverage --root . --policy "$PWD/cairn-policy/generated/cairn-policy.json" --json
   nix flake check path:$PWD --no-write-lock-file -L
   ```

Run credential-isolated acquisition separately from a normal operator build: existing Cargo/Nix caches and credential helpers can conceal an inaccessible source input. Use a fresh temporary HOME/source cache with no Git/SSH credentials or global Git configuration, and acquire all direct and transitive sources before claiming the public quick start is reproducible. Consult `LICENSES.md` before combining adapters into a distributed executable.

For release preparation, bind actual command results to the exact validated source payload and retain failures. The original files under `evidence/` are historical publication evidence, not current check receipts. See `hosting-and-recovery.md` for the boundary between local preparation and separately authorized publication.


## Status

Status has three separate facets:

- readiness reports holds, delays, dependencies, and provider-local capacity;
- execution reports dispatch and provider observations;
- outcome reports the canonical attempt result.

Status is a rebuildable projection. It cannot mutate journal state.

## Logs and follow

A cursor binds one exact stream and byte offset. A read reports gaps when retained data no longer contains that offset.

A completed follow reports the final cursor and terminal stream state. Truncation does not change an attempt outcome.

## Wait

A wait request binds an exact selection and one named predicate. A client deadline changes only the client result.

The supported predicates are `all_terminal`, `any_terminal`, and `all_successful`.

## Capacity and readiness

Global tenant fairness runs before provider-local capacity admission. Capacity classes do not select workers or calculate tenant shares.

The shell supplies time and capacity observations. The core does not read a clock or poll a provider.

## Controls

An admission hold stops new dispatches in its scope. It does not pause a running attempt.

Cancellation, pause, and resume require an exact active attempt. They also require the provider capability.

Kiln does not support arbitrary process input as a standard control.

## SQLite event store

`kiln-adapter-sqlite` pins `rusqlite 0.40.2`, `libsqlite3-sys 0.38.2`, and bundled SQLite `3.53.2`.

The profile uses immediate transactions, WAL, and `FULL` synchronization. Each transaction commits accepted events, stream revision, and outbox records together.

Before retention, write a snapshot at the exact retention boundary. Replay rejects a retained history without that snapshot.

Use `backup_to` only with a new destination. The adapter runs SQLite integrity checks and records the backup BLAKE3 identity.

Schema changes require an admitted migration edge. Unknown or partially applied versions stop service admission without destructive repair.

## Recovery

Restore the latest committed journal snapshot. Then classify each outbox lease.

Reconcile expired or ambiguous effects before redispatch. Do not claim exactly-once provider execution.
